He opened the door and I took my bag up to my room to unpack. When I was done I slumped back onto my bed. The tiredness washed over me and I sat up to stop myself from nodding off.\n“Sleepover” is a weird word. There had been no sleep. The weight of being awake for 24 hours was pushing on my head and I felt like I might just collapse into a pile of dust.\nIf there was one thing I knew about sleep (or lack thereof) it was that you need to keep the times consistent. If I fell asleep now then it would mess up everything and I didn’t want that, especially just before our holiday.\nI needed to do something. I turned around to face my bed but something was wrong. Something was missing. My heart skipped a beat as I realised and I turned and ran down the hall and into my brother’s room.\n“Timmy!” I yelled at the top of my voice. “You stole it!“. He hadn’t even tried to hide it. On the floor, next to his bed was my Justin Bieber body pillow. I grabbed it by the feet and pulled it towards me.\nTimmy didn’t look sorry at all. He just looked at me with one of those looks that makes adults’ anger melt instantly. I swung Justin by the feet and slammed it across his face. The force knocked him clean over and he sprawled onto the carpet. I bolted back to my room and slammed the door before his bawling echoed down the hallway. I heard the sound of my mum’s footsteps on the stairs and knew I was in trouble.\n~\nThe bus doors opened and I waited for the large group ahead of us to get off. Timmy, being who he was, ducked and swerved though the crowd and rushed to the doors. The old lady he has just cut off grabbed onto the railing to save herself from falling. Mum seemed oblivious. Dad actually looked away. I cursed at them in my head and stared daggers at their shadows.\nThe wait was worth it though. The highlight of our holiday, the grand canyon. Something I had only seen on TV. It seemed bigger and deeper in real life.\nTimmy, who had got off the bus long before all of us, was already by the canyon and was sitting on the fence. There was a strange gap in the people around him as if people were trying to disassociate themselves with this odd child. But that was not my thought I ran at him. The boy who had haunted my existence since the sad say of his birth, sitting on the edge of this colossal chasm, staring innocently down."},"English/25-10-16":{"slug":"English/25-10-16","filePath":"English/25-10-16.md","title":"25-10-16","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"D - Direct Address\nA - Alliteration\nF - Facts\nO - Opinions\nR - Repetition\nR - Rhetorical Questions\nE - Emotive Language\nS - Statistics\nT - Triplets"},"English/25-11-06":{"slug":"English/25-11-06","filePath":"English/25-11-06.md","title":"25-11-06","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Proceed with Purpose—Writing about Non-fiction\nPEWE\n\nPoint\nEvidence\nWriter\nExplain\n\nThe writer presents ideas about how to save the environment through becoming a Womble.

We produce over 15 million kWh of electricity every year, enough to power roughly 8,700 households.\nCan you tell us about the turbines?\nWe have nine turbines on the farm, each producing about 2 megawatts of power. They are all 103 metres tall and can spin at 60 rpm in good wind.\nWhat is the lifespan of one of the turbines?\nThese kinds of turbine can last for 20-25 years with good maintenance.\nDo the turbines interfere with the birds? Do birds get hit by the blades?\nYes, birds do often fly into the blades of the turbines but the amount of birds killed by wind turbines is fairly small, less than the bird deaths from cats or flying into buildings.\nDo you believe that wind power is the future of eco-power?\nI think that wind power is definitely a very good and eco-friendly power source but it can’t power the world alone. Other power sources like solar panels are also needed to keep up with the ever-increasing power demand.\nWhat has improved in wind power in the last decade that the public wouldn’t know about?\nThere have been a lot of improvements to wind farms in the last decade. The main improvements that are constantly being made to turbines are increased hub height and bigger blades, allowing the turbines to catch more wind.\nWhat improvements are still needing to be made?\nDue to its simple nature, wind power isn’t advancing super fast. The main thing we need now is more wind farms. Wind power has come a long way but it’s still got a long way to go before it replaces all non-renewable energy.\nWhat is something that everyone should know about wind power?\nWind power has the second least carbon emissions of any power source after nuclear power. Nuclear power has it’s own problems, so at least at the moment, wind power is our best source of energy.

We all rely on it, take it for granted, but often forget where it comes from and the side effects of its production. We use electricity every minute of every day but rarely stop and think. I want you to think back to yesterday. Every light you turned on, every time you charged your phone, every time you used your oven, all the electricity you used. Now think of every other person in the world, and all the offices, factories and shops. We use a lot of electricity every day. 75,000 gWh of electricity and rising fast.\nBut where does this electricity come from? Well this is where the problem lies. Only 44.9% of the UK’s energy comes from renewable sources. Climate change has become a huge issue and non-renewable energy is a massive part of it. Over 40% of carbon-dioxide emissions are from generating electricity.\nWe are, however, moving closer to green energy, but it’s not as perfect or simple as it might seem. In this article we are going to be discussing all the good and bad things about different types of green energy, specifically wind power.\nWind power turns the kinetic energy of the wind into electrical energy using turbines. The wind blows the blades of the turbine which turn a gearbox and then a generator. The most powerful wind turbine is a prototype from the Chinese company Dongfang Electric which has a power rating of 26MW. For comparison, an average UK house hold draws about 0.8kW of electricity.\nWind turbines come in two main variants: onshore and offshore. They are fundamentally the same but have a couple of key differences, the main one being that offshore turbines can be much bigger. Offshore wind farms can be huge, having well over 100 turbines.\n\n\n                  \n                  Pros \n                  \n                \n\n\nLow CO2\nLots of space in the sea for offshore wind farms\nCost effective - 1-2 cents per kWh\nSpace effective- the land can still be used for things like agriculture\n\n\n\nThe main advantage of wind power over other sources of energy is the low emissions. Wind power the emissions from wind energy are about 12g per kWh of electricity including the emissions from the production of the turbines and maintenance. The IPCC (1) has calculated a mean average of emissions for lots of power sources from a series of studies and wind power is listed as the source that emits the least carbon-dioxide.\nAnother major advantage of wind power is that it’s easily scalable. There is a lot of space in the sea for offshore wind farms. They are also highly cost effective. Offshore wind power can be produced for a little as $0.01 per kWh. This includes construction, operation and maintenance. Onshore wind is slightly cheaper to produce since they are just turbines and don’t need any surrounding structure.\nThey are also highly space efficient. The land around an onshore wind farm can still be used for something like agriculture as the turbines don’t take up a lot of ground space at their base.\n\n\n                  \n                  Cons \n                  \n                \n\n\nUgly\nBirds\nInstallation\nWeather dependant\n\n\n\nHowever, as with most things, its not all good. There are some major downsides to wind power but a lot of them only apply to onshore wind. A fairly common issue people have with wind turbines is that wind farms are ugly and they ruin landscapes. Of course this only applies to onshore wind but it can cause a huge barrier when getting planning permission.\nI’ve already mentioned how wind farms don’t talk up a whole lot of ground space but that is only when they are running. Installation can be very disrupting to the surroundings due to the heavy machinery required.\nAnother thing that people often say about wind turbines is that they kill birds. While this is true, people are often unaware of the scale that this happens at. In the US, domestic cats are responsible for roughly one billion bird deaths every year while wind turbines only cause about 150,000. Turbines killing birds is not a huge issue and some manufacturers are now making their turbine blades black to reduce bird deaths even further.\nBut the main fundamental issue with wind power is that wind power is entirely weather dependant. If there is no wind, a turbine can’t make any power. This is a fundamental problem with the way that wind power works and there is no way to fix this. The only way around is storing the power.\nLarge scale power storage is already a thing, the largest is Dinorwig in North Wales. Seven billion litres of water are pumped 550 metres up a mountain and then flow back down through a generator when the power is needed. This method of power storage is currently the only thing we have at this scale but has a few core issues, the first being efficiency: it takes 3 units of power to pump the water up to the top and it will release 2 units of power on the way back down meaning that a third of the power is lost. Another downside is the money required to build it. Something like Dinorwig is very expensive to build, Dinorwig its self cost £425 million.\nBut the big question still has not been answered. Are wind turbines the future of energy? That is entirely down to you. After reading about all the advantages and all the problems, what do you think?\n\n(1) - Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change"},"_Climatology/6-Speech":{"slug":"_Climatology/6-Speech","filePath":"_Climatology/6 Speech.md","title":"6 Speech","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"“How many times must a man look up before he can see the sky?”\nThat’s a quote from a famous song by Bob Dylan. I love that line because it reminds me that sometimes what we need is actually right there in front of us. I will argue that that is also the case with climate change.\nWe can actually replace some of the biggest sources of the problem, oil, coal and gas, with something we have in abundance: wind. In my country, Denmark, we are doing just that.\nNothing makes a Dane proud like the knowledge that something we have done makes a positive difference in the world. Historically speaking, we’ve made a difference before. 1,000 years ago, countrymen of mine controlled most of northern Europe. I’m sure you’ve heard of them: The Vikings.\nNow I will make the case today that in order for us to fight climate change, we actually need to learn from the Vikings. But before we get to that, please indulge me. I have take you back in time. Not all the way back to the Viking age in the heydays of Harald “Bluetooth,” but to the 1970s during the oil crisis in Denmark. To a small workshop, in a barn, in a farm, in a village, in Denmark.\nMeet Henrik Stiesdal.\nHe’s not an accomplished, experienced engineer. He’s 19 years old. He set himself a challenge. He thought, “What if I could make a wind turbine that could produce electricity?” And you know what? He did. And eventually he actually sold the design to a company called Vestas. You might have heard of them because they are the biggest turbine producer in the world today. So the story of wind power in Denmark is the story about how one turbine, on one farm sparked a transformation that influenced the whole country.\nWe are a green frontrunner, but we need to do more because at the same time, we rank as one of the biggest oil producers in the EU. This has to change. And it will. We’ve decided to put an end date on extraction of oil and gas in 2050 and immediately cancel all future licensing rounds. That wasn’t an easy decision. But the reason we made it, even though it was expensive, was because we need to show the world that there are actually alternatives to oil and gas.\nNow, some of you are probably thinking that sounds very good, but how will you do it? Surely you cannot fly a jet plane without jet fuels? Surely you cannot sail a big container ship without bunker oil?\nBut actually, you can. This is an electrolyzer. It transforms electricity into hydrogen. And that, friends, that’s the game changer. Because the hydrogen can be transformed into green fuels. The wind in the North Sea is transformed by a turbine into electricity. The electrolyzer transforms that into hydrogen, and the hydrogen is then made into green, sustainable fuels that we can use to sail our ships and fly our planes. I know it sounds like science fiction, but actually it’s just science.\nSome of you are probably thinking, “What does this have to do with the Vikings?” Do you know what it was that made the Vikings so successful? Their secret? They exploited the wind. And that brings me to my main point. We need, as the Vikings did 1,000 years ago, to change the world by finding new and more efficient ways of exploiting the energy.\nNow, some people will probably tell you that a small country cannot make a big difference. I beg to differ. When a young man like Henrik could make a difference for a whole country, why not also believe that a country like Denmark can make a difference for a whole world? If you ask the International Energy Agency, they will tell you that offshore wind has the potential to cover the current electricity demand of the entire world, not once, not twice, 18 times.\nSo when you go to Denmark, you’ll meet a Dane. Try and ask them, “How do you think we should solve the climate crisis?” Chances are, they will say, “The answer, my friend, is literally blowing in the wind.”\nThank you."},"_Climatology/Newsletter-Plan":{"slug":"_Climatology/Newsletter-Plan","filePath":"_Climatology/Newsletter Plan.md","title":"Newsletter Plan","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\nEditors note\nLetter to the editor\nTranscript from a lecture\nInterview with an expert\n\n1 (L)\nTeam + contents\n2 (R)\nEditors note\n3+4\nInterview with a wind farm manager\n5 (L)\nBig picture of turbine\n6 (R)\nLabelled blueprint of a turbine\n7+8\nMain article: Are wind turbines the future of energy?\nLetter at edge\n9 (L)\nAdvert\n10 (R)\nLecture about green electricity sources\n11+12\nPuzzles!"},"_Climatology/Presentation":{"slug":"_Climatology/Presentation","filePath":"_Climatology/Presentation.md","title":"Presentation","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\nTalk about what wind power is, how it works -1\nSome statistics\n44.9% of UK energy is from renewable sources - 2\n24.2% of UK energy is from wind power - 3\nEmissions\nOffshore wind only for this bit - 4\nAssuming each turbine runs for 25 years (average) &lt;1% of emissions of fossil fuels\nWind: 6g/kWh - 5\nCoal: 900g/kWh\nOther Risks/Downsides\nRuining landscapes - 6\nBirds: More birds die to cats than wind turbines\nRecycling: Most materials in a turbine are recyclable\nØrsted\nDONG energy - 7\nDanish - 8\nStarted in 1972 as a state owned company to manage oil and gas resources - 9\nTransitioned to renewable energy in 2017 and became Ørsted - 10\nSold all its oil and gas business to Ineos $1.05 billion\nLargest offshore wind farm company in the world\nLargest producer of power in Denmark\nUS screwed them over in 2021 with new restrictions on offshore wind farms - 11\nUpcoming magazine - 12"},"_Climatology/Sources":{"slug":"_Climatology/Sources","filePath":"_Climatology/Sources.md","title":"Sources","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\nclimate.mit.edu/\nwww.thewindpower.net/\nlumifyenergy.com/\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_powerful_wind_turbines\n\n\nCover image - Photo by Seth on Unsplash\n\nChris Cooke - www.youtube.com/@cookec21\nDenis Egan - en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinorwig_Power_Station#/media/File:DinorwigPowerStation01.jpg\nMade From The Sky on Unsplash\n"},"_History/Book-Work/1-Early-Human-Evolution":{"slug":"_History/Book-Work/1-Early-Human-Evolution","filePath":"_History/Book Work/1 Early Human Evolution.md","title":"1 Early Human Evolution","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Imagine back to millions of years ago.

They are only the closest still alive.\nHominins were an early human-like species group. The first known hominin lived about 7 million years ago in central Africa. There were many species, and they gradually evolved towards Homo Sapiens (humans).\nAs the hominins continued to evolve, advances like cooking of food and making stone tools meant faster brain development and safer living, helping these species become more dominant than the ones without.\nAbout 2 million years ago, Homo Erectus were the first hominin to migrate out of Africa. They were very similar to Homo Sapiens and had a brain far larger than any of the other Hominins. About 200,000 years ago, Homo Sapiens emerged.

It has no purpose or use other than to just be nice, and so is one of the earlies pieces of art.\nWhen it was discovered in the Lone Valley in Germany in 1939, it was in pieces and had to be reconstructed by specialists. Excavation began again after the war and continued until 2012-13 when most of the pieces had been found. It has been studied and analysed a lot since then.\nSigns of wear around its middle suggest that it has been handled a lot, not just left and looked at, and it was probably used for some kind of ceremony or ritual. It is one of the oldest representations of a being that does not exist in nature.\nA few years ago artist Wulf Hein recreated the Lowenmensch using the same tools and techniques that would have been used to create the original and it took him over 400 hours. The original sculptor would not have been able to hunt or gather during the carving so would have been supported by his community, meaning the Lowenmensch must have had some special value to the group.\n\n\n                  \n                  A real artist made this.

They weigh up to 10 tons and are angled towards Sirius, the brightest star in the sky.\nHowever, the odd thing about Göbekli Tepe: no other settlements have been discovered near by. This suggests that Göbekli Tepe was a joint effort of lots of groups. But how did they all meet at this place? Why here? Sadly there is probably no way to answer these questions, we can only guess. The most likely use of the site was rituals. Lots of tribes would have come to the site for a ceremony. There are no signs that anyone lived there.\nThe complexity of Göbekli Tepe shows that the people of this time were able to plan, design and construct very complex things, even with the very simple tools they had. Only a small amount of the site has been excavated but surveys have shown that there is more to the structure that is still buried.\nGöbekli Tepe is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is one of the earliest examples of human architecture.

It started with the harvesting of naturally growing wheat. The people discovered how to turn it into flour, dough and flatbread. But the process was slow. Extracting the grains from the wheat ears was a difficult and time consuming process. Many kinds of tools where invented to help the process.\nHaving more available food meant the population grew and the population growing meant more demand for food. The people started to plant grains closer to home, creating fields of crops. Now instead of hunter-gatherers, who were always moving, the people settled in one place and built more permanent homes and villages.\nTowns grew around the agriculture, forming fewer larger groups; the people started to keep cows and sheep, meaning better clothes and easy meat. But some groups were doing better than others; they had more wheat, healthier cows, better wool. The towns with less started to envy the towns with more and they started to steal. Towns built defences against intruders and appointed leaders and defenders.\nThe agricultural revolution brought many positive things to society: permanent settlements, more stable food supply, trading and advances in technology and tools. But it wasn’t all good. With people and animals living together, diseases started to spread like smallpox and measles. People separated into groups and fought over land and possessions.\nBut whether it was good or bad, the agricultural revolution was a huge turning point in human development and brought us closer to where we are today."},"_History/Book-Work/5-Catal-Hoyuk":{"slug":"_History/Book-Work/5-Catal-Hoyuk","filePath":"_History/Book Work/5 Catal Hoyuk.md","title":"5 Catal Hoyuk","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Çatal Höyuk is an ancient settlement found in southern Turkey.

It was discovered by James Mellaart in 1958 and excavated throughout the 1960s and 1990s. In 2012 Çatal Höyuk became a World Heritage Site.\nÇatal Höyuk was very different to cities and towns today. There were no streets or roads, the people walked on the roofs. The only entrance to the houses was down a ladder through a hole in the roof. The hole also acted as a chimney. The cooking was done on the second floor under the hole. They slept on the bottom floor, all on a raised platform surrounded by mammoth tusks. The exact reason for the mammoth tusks is unknown but it is thought to be for spiritual protection. The houses were built from mudbrick and wood and all the houses were more or less the same. This indicates that there was no social hierarchy.\nThe dead were buried underneath the sleeping platform in pits which were then covered. The bodies were bound tightly in the foetal position to fit in the holes. The holes would be periodically reopened to for bodies to be added. The houses were decorated with wall paintings and sculptures, a lot of them suggesting some spiritual belief.

Many scholars consider it to be the first true city. Its even mentioned in the bible (referred to as Erech). Between 3500 and 3000 BCE, Uruk dominated Mesopotamia and is so influential that it gave its name to a whole archaeological period: the Uruk Period.\nAt its peak, Uruk had a population of around 40,000 people (about the same as Salisbury) which was huge for the times. It it between two rivers, the Tigris and the Euphrates and had lots of canals connected to the rivers. The canals were used for transport around the city.\nUruk contained large ziggurats (temples for public worship) including the Anu ziggurat, one of the best preserved structures in the city. The houses were made from mud bricks and were built around the canals.\nThe very first writing, small pictograms in clay, was found in Uruk, c. 3200 BCE. This is what later evolved into cuneiform writing, the first established form of writing.\nThe legendary king Gilgamesh is thought to have ruled Uruk around 2700 BCE. He is said to have built the city wall and he is the protagonist of the oldest known epic poem, the Epic of Gilgamesh which is written in cuneiform on clay tablets.\nUruk was invaded, destroyed and rebuilt many times until c. 300 CE when it was gradually abandoned due to a shift in the Euphrates river.\nToday Uruk is a important archaeological site for understanding the people and society of the time and marks a key point in human development due to its size."},"_History/Book-Work/8-Hammurabi":{"slug":"_History/Book-Work/8-Hammurabi","filePath":"_History/Book Work/8 Hammurabi.md","title":"8 Hammurabi","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Hammurabi was the King of Babylon from 1792 to 1750 BCE. During his reign he created the Code of Hammurabi, one of the earliest and most complete legal codes. It was written in cuneiform on a basalt stele that was over two metres tall. It was first erected in Babylon in the temple of Marduk but is thought to have later been stolen as it was found in the ancient city of Susa, Persia (now Iran).\nWritten on the stele was not only the laws but a prologue and epilogue about the greatness of King Hammurabi. There were 282 laws in total and they spanned many areas of law: family, property, trade, employment, crime and civil law. All the laws listed a crime and a punishment for that crime but the punishment differed by social class, for example, slaves were considered property and had limited legal rights.\n\nIf any one strike the body of a man higher in rank than he, he shall receive sixty blows with an ox-whip in public.\n\nSome of the laws were not particularly fair and often the accuser would be punished if they could not prove guilt. For example: If any one bring an accusation of any crime before the elders, and does not prove what he has charged, he shall, if it be a capital offence charged, be put to death.\nA lot of the listed crimes were punished by death and lots were on the basis of suffering what you did to another:\nIf a man knock out the teeth of his equal, his teeth shall be knocked out.\nIf a man put out the eye of another man, his eye shall be put out.\nIf he break another man’s bone, his bone shall be broken.\nThe code also talks about rates of pay for different jobs and products.\nIf any one hire a field laborer, he shall pay him eight gur of corn per year.\nIf any one hire an ox-driver, he shall pay him six gur of corn per year.\nAlthough these laws seem harsh they were a significant improvement on previous Assyrian law which involved whipping and dismembering of body parts.\nThe stele is now in the Louvre in Paris.\n"},"_History/Book-Work/9-Bronze-Age-Collapse":{"slug":"_History/Book-Work/9-Bronze-Age-Collapse","filePath":"_History/Book Work/9 Bronze Age Collapse.md","title":"9 Bronze Age Collapse","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"The term Bronze Age Collapse refers to the fall of settlements in Mesopotamia and around the Mediterranean.

Egyptian texts describe an invasion and archaeologists have found evidence of cities being burned down.\nAnother theory is natural disasters. There is evidence of big earthquakes happening around this time which would have collapsed city walls and houses, making the cities uninhabitable and leaving the people homeless and in danger.\nThere is also evidence of climate change and drought in fossilised pollen. This would have caused crops to fail, livestock to die and so a widespread famine. Another theory is an uprising of peasants which could have been caused by the famine.\nAny of these things could have caused the rapid failing of the civilisation.

How could we have got anywhere without being able to talk to each other? Look the animal kingdom. Any species that does more than wander around and eat leaves has some form of communication. Birds have special calls for danger, bees use body language to tell the hive where the flowers are and even antisocial animals like cats have a way of expressing their dislike of each other.\nImagine trying to build a pyramid but you have no way of communicating with anyone else, not even pointing or waving. Now imagine you can point, it’s not much but the construction might now be possible. Now imagine it with very crude language. You can now do things like asking for help or requesting more stone to be fetched. Its getting easier but would still take a long time and a lot of mishaps. Now imagine it with a fully formed language. Someone can now take charge and direct the construction. People can be assigned jobs, progress can be reported and the whole thing would be so much easier.\nNow add writing to the mix. Records can now be kept without worry of forgetting or slight changes when information is passed by word of mouth. Large lists can be made, letters can be sent. Humans are the only animals with a way of recording information in symbols and it has changed the way we live so dramatically.\nLets go back to the pyramid and add writing to the mix. Records of progress can now be written, designs can be made and lists of materials can be sent to where they need to go. This changes everything again and speeds up construction even more.\nBut none of this would have come around if it wasn’t for fire. The harnessing of fire changed everything in so many ways. The ability to cook food, meaning faster brain development; a controllable light source, in fact the only light source besides the sun; and a bringer of safety and warmth at night. All of this meant that the people had more time and could do things other than keeping themselves alive. They started to tell stories, make art, sing songs and have some sense of community. This might be the most important landmarks in human development due to the volume of things that wouldn’t have happened without it.\nThe power of humans has always been their ability to work together for the benefit of the group, to be selfless and to consider others needs as well as their own.

They do the simple task of changing high power, small distance into low power, large distance or vice versa. There are three types (or classes) of lever, determined by the order of the components: load, effort and fulcrum.\nA first class lever is your typical lever. It has the fulcrum in the middle and the load and effort either side. The conversion of the force depends on the distances between the fulcrum and effort, and the fulcrum and load. This type of lever is the main component in scales and see-saws.\nA second class lever has the load in the middle and the fulcrum and effort at the ends. It turns a low power, high distance effort into a high power, low distance force. This type of lever is useful for lifting heavy things and exerting a large amount of force onto something. Nut crackers are made of a pair of second class levers.\nThird class levers have the effort in the middle and turn high power, low distance into high distance, low power. Chop sticks, tweezers, clap boards and even elbows are third class levers.\nLevers are a key part of so many machines and have been used for thousands of years. They were used in the construction of the pyramids and are a key part of steam engines. Think about any piece of moving machinery. How many levers are there in it? There is almost certainly at least one and probably more. Even though levers have been used for thousands of years, the mathematics of levers wasn’t done until Greek times and is credited to Archimedes and his Law of Levers.\nBalance Experiment\nEquipment\n\nFirst class lever with evenly spread hooks\nSet of equal weights\n\nMethod\nThe lever setup was checked to make sure it was balanced with no weights and then different combinations of weights were added on each side to find what balanced.\nObservations\nThe lever was balanced when two weights were put on opposite sides in the same place. When they were different distances from the fulcrum, the side with the weight further out went down. When a pair of weights was on one side and only one weight on the other, the pair of weights needed to be half as far out as the single weight for the lever to balance. If one of the pair of weights was moved inwards and one outwards, the lever would stay balanced.\nConclusion\nWeights on a scale or first class lever are more “effective” the further out they are from the fulcrum; the amount of influence that a weight has on the balance increases in a linear fashion as it is moved further from the fulcrum."},"_Physics/Book/Pulleys":{"slug":"_Physics/Book/Pulleys","filePath":"_Physics/Book/Pulleys.md","title":"Pulleys","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Introduction"},"_Physics/W1-D3":{"slug":"_Physics/W1-D3","filePath":"_Physics/W1-D3.md","title":"W1-D3","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Alin’s Experiment Name Format:\nW1L1A\nW1: Week 1\nL1: Lesson 1\nA/B: Two experiments each day"},"_Physics/W1-D4":{"slug":"_Physics/W1-D4","filePath":"_Physics/W1-D4.md","title":"W1-D4","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Recall of yesterday\n\n\n"},"_Physics/W2-D2":{"slug":"_Physics/W2-D2","filePath":"_Physics/W2-D2.md","title":"W2-D2","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Kat GH: Katxx23"},"_Physics/W3-D4":{"slug":"_Physics/W3-D4","filePath":"_Physics/W3-D4.md","title":"W3-D4","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"100cm: 9.9, 10.0, 10.1 (AVG: 10.0)\n20cm: 4.4, 4.4, 4.3 (AVG: 4.4)"},"_Physics/W3-D5":{"slug":"_Physics/W3-D5","filePath":"_Physics/W3-D5.md","title":"W3-D5","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"_Physics/Why-Alin's-calculations-are-wrong---scientific-research-paper":{"slug":"_Physics/Why-Alin's-calculations-are-wrong---scientific-research-paper","filePath":"_Physics/Why Alin's calculations are wrong - scientific research paper.md","title":"Why Alin's calculations are wrong - scientific research paper","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"1. Introduction\nThe tennis ball dropping experiment was conducted by dropping a tennis ball from a balcony.\nAlin has made a calculation for the fall time of the tennis ball from the balcony. His result is 0.5 - 0.7 seconds. I am going to prove this wrong.\n2. Numbers\nIn this document, the following variables will be used:\nr - radius of the ball = 0.033m\nH - start height of the fall = 4.38m\nc - drag coefficient of the ball = 0.53\ng - gravity = 9.8\nw - weight of the ball = 0.0572kg\n\\rho - air density = 1.004 (real air density at 7th November 2025 at 9:00)\nNote on units: Meters, seconds and kilograms will be used throughout\n3. Calculations\nNow I will calculate the fall time for the tennis ball using the above numbers, first without air resistance, and then with.\n3.1 Without Air Resistance\nThe formula for fall time without air is:\nt=\\sqrt{2H \\over g}\nPlugging in the values we get:\nt=\\sqrt{2 \\times 4.38 \\over 9.8}\nSolve for t:\nt=\\sqrt{2 \\times 4.38 \\over 9.8} = \\sqrt{8.78 \\over 9.8} \\approx \\sqrt{0.894} \\approx \\boldsymbol{0.946}\nSo without air, the fall time would be \\approx 0.946\n3.2 With Air Resistance\nTo calculate the distance that a body has fallen after a given amount of time, we can use this formula:\nf\\left(t\\right)=\\frac{2m}{\\rho cA}\\ln\\left(\\left[\\cosh\\left(t\\sqrt{\\frac{g\\rho cA}{2m}}\\right)\\right]\\right)\nThis formula uses calculus to calculate the distance an object has fallen after a given amount of time.\nIf we plot this together with y=4.38 for the distance we find that they intersect at y=0.98993 so that is the fall time, with air resistance, for the tennis ball.\n4. Conclusion\nThe fall time for the tennis ball in a vacuum would be roughly 0.946 seconds.\nThe fall time with air resistance should be roughly 0.99 seconds.\n\n\n                  \n                  Note on buoyancy \n                  \n                \n\nBuoyancy calculations have not been done here. This is because the difference that it makes to the final number is within the error margin of the calculations and would therefor be fairly pointless.\n\n"},"_Physics/Work-Plan-Sat":{"slug":"_Physics/Work-Plan-Sat","filePath":"_Physics/Work Plan Sat.md","title":"Work Plan Sat","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\n Levers Writing\n Levers diagram in book\n Fix GH Build Action\n"},"_Poetry/Friday-Poem":{"slug":"_Poetry/Friday-Poem","filePath":"_Poetry/Friday Poem.md","title":"Friday Poem","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Tea\nReading\nQuiet\nTogether\nThe sweet smell of tea\nThe rustling of pages\nVoices whispering"},"_Poetry/Haiku-History":{"slug":"_Poetry/Haiku-History","filePath":"_Poetry/Haiku History.md","title":"Haiku History","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"The haiku is a very short form of poetry that comes from Japan. A haiku is made up of just three lines and usually focuses on nature or a small moment in time. Because of its simplicity, the haiku encourages the reader to slow down and think carefully about what is being described.\nHaikus originated in Japan several hundred years ago. It developed from an older form of poetry called renga. The opening verse of a renga was called a hokku, and over time this opening verse became more important on its own. Eventually, the hokku became what we now call the haiku.\nA haiku follows a syllable pattern of 5 syllables in the first line, 7 in the second, and 5 in the third. Haikus usually include a reference to nature or the seasons, known as a kigo, and contain a pause or break in thought called a kireji, which adds meaning or contrast. The kireji comes from a Japanese-English language difference in how punctuation works.\nThe most famous haiku poet is Matsuo Bashō, who lived in the 17th century. Bashō helped turn haiku into a respected form of poetry. His haikus often described nature, travel, and everyday moments, such as the sound of water.\nHaiku later spread beyond Japan to other parts of the world and poets began writing haikus in their own languages. Because different languages work differently, many writers outside Japan focused less on strict syllable counts and more on the overall feeling of the poem. English haikus often keep the three-line structure but don’t always follow the 5-7-5 pattern exactly.\nHaikus are still very popular. Modern haikus can be about almost anything, not just nature. Some poets write about emotions, daily life, or modern technology. Even though the subject matter has changed, the main idea of capturing a brief moment remains the same."},"_Poetry/Haiku":{"slug":"_Poetry/Haiku","filePath":"_Poetry/Haiku.md","title":"Haiku","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"The parting of clouds\nA beam of sun shining down\nThen the beam is gone\nThe chill of the air\nThe echo of my breathing\nThrough the mossy headstones\nDark rain clouds above\nThe icy cold wind blowing\nWinter is still here\nThe darkness of night\nThe patter of night time rain\nA storm is coming\nThe grass in the wind\nThe sway of the tall flowers\nThe swing of branches"},"_Poetry/Poetry-and-Me":{"slug":"_Poetry/Poetry-and-Me","filePath":"_Poetry/Poetry and Me.md","title":"Poetry and Me","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"I’ve always enjoyed poetry. From fairly young I was read poems by my parents and grandparents and then read them by myself when I could read. I always enjoyed picture books with rhymes and tongue twisters, especially Dr Seuss; and nonsense poems like those of Spike Milligan, Edward Lear and Michael Rosen. I remember reading the Dr Seuss books and struggling to say all the words.\nMy favourite has got to be Fox in Socks and I can still say several parts of it from memory. I also remember several Spike Milligan poems like The Ning Nang Nong (featuring later in this book) and Bongaloo. Now that I am older I enjoy slightly different poetry but still of a similar style like Brian Bilston. His poetry is very funny and different but not entirely meaningless or complete nonsense. He writes about very real and current subjects but keeps it approachable and light. A couple of my favourites by him are How much I dislike the Daily Mail, Mnemonic and his many hilarious haikus.\nI don’t particularly like long, drawn out and unrhythmic poems. I was forced to sit through lots of these poems during lockdown when my grandpa would read them to me, my sister and our cousins over Zoom. I think this might have been what put me off serious poetry but I have more recently enjoyed some more serious poems like Dulce et Decorum Est by Wilfred Owen.\nThe thing I love about poetry is the rhythms. As a very musical person, complex rhythms and beats feel very satisfying to me. Poems with strong repeating rhythms stick in my head. I also like the deeper meanings behind poems. How you have to draw your own conclusions and uncover hidden meanings by thinking about it from a different angle. You could see something that the poet didn’t intend to say but that speaks to you, and that’s the magic of poetry, and why I think that dissecting and analysing poems is spoiling them. It loses the magic, forces you to see it from a certain angle.\nI think that poems are a very special art form and form of expression. It carries a deep meaning or message, like music, but it’s not always obvious, like art. It is a very special form of writing that comes in so many forms and everyone can enjoy it if they find the right flavour."},"_Poetry/Sestina-History":{"slug":"_Poetry/Sestina-History","filePath":"_Poetry/Sestina History.md","title":"Sestina History","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"The sestina is a type of poem that is known for being very challenging to write. It is not as common as the sonnet, but it is still an important poetic form. It repeats the same six words at the ends of lines in a specific pattern. It doesn’t follow a meter or have a set line length.\nThe sestina originated in the twelfth century in France and was created by a poet named Arnaut Daniel. Daniel was known for writing complicated poems, and the sestina is one of his most famous inventions. At the time, poetry was often performed out loud, and the repeated words helped listeners follow the poem more easily.\nA sestina is made up of six stanzas, each with six lines, followed by a final three-line stanza called an envoi. The same six words are used at the end of every line, but they appear in a different order each time. This order is very strict and follows a set pattern. In the envoi, all six words appear again, two per line. Because the poet cannot change the end words, writing a sestina requires very careful planning and choosing of the words.\nWhen the sestina spread to Italy during the Middle Ages, and then to the rest of Europe during the Renaissance. Some poets avoided it because it was difficult to write and very restrictive. However, others enjoyed the challenge and used the repetition to help the tone of the poem.\nPoets still write sestinas today, although not as much. Writers such as Elizabeth Bishop have written sestinas about emotional subjects, just like they would have been originally."},"_Poetry/Sestina-Print":{"slug":"_Poetry/Sestina-Print","filePath":"_Poetry/Sestina Print.md","title":"Sestina Print","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Sat at the bottom because of the other.\nStaring off through the mist into the distance.\nThese infinite impenetrable spaces unending,\nA liminal world, unimaginable depth.\nThe unknown beyond, don’t peek behind the veil,\nThe echoing emptiness may not be empty.\nThe echoing chambers not quite empty,\nThis is the doing of the other.\nThis is not safe, don’t peek behind the veil;\nYou don’t know what’s in the distance.\nYou are not safe down in the depth,\nYour suffering will come to an ending.\nDon’t let the darkness be unending,\nDon’t let the emptiness be empty.\nDon’t let the liminal space’s depth,\nStretch more than the depth of the heart of the other.\nPull back the deep dark infinite distance\nTake a look behind the veil\nBut in the darkness behind the veil\nI feel suffering and no ending.\nStay away, keep your distance\nThe echoing emptiness is not empty.\nStay away, don’t challenge the other\nDon’t fall down into the depth.\nBut I must fall into the depth,\nPush aside the veil\nAnd challenge the other,\nThis is the only way to an ending.\nMake the emptiness not empty,\nSee what’s in the distance.\nNow you have travelled this distance,\nFell down to this depth,\nSeen that the emptiness is not empty,\nPushed aside the veil,\nAnd reached for this ending.\nIn spite of the other.\n\nThe distance behind the veil,\nThe depth of the ending,\nThe emptiness of the other."},"_Poetry/Sestina":{"slug":"_Poetry/Sestina","filePath":"_Poetry/Sestina.md","title":"Sestina","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\n\n                  \n                  Words \n                  \n                \n\nA Other\nB Distance\nC Unending\nD Depth\nE Veil\nF Empty\n\n\nA Sat at the bottom because of the other.\nB Staring off through the mist into the distance.\nC These infinite impenetrable spaces unending,\nD A liminal world, unimaginable depth.\nE The unknown beyond, don’t peek behind the veil,\nF The echoing emptiness may not be empty.\nF The echoing chambers not quite empty,\nA This is the doing of the other.\nE This is not safe, don’t peek behind the veil;\nB You don’t know what’s in the distance.\nD You are not safe down in the depth,\nC Your suffering will come to an ending.\nC Don’t let the darkness be unending,\nF Don’t let the emptiness be empty.\nD Don’t let the liminal space’s depth,\nA Stretch more than the depth of the heart of the other.\nB Pull back the deep dark infinite distance\nE Take a look behind the veil\nE But in the darkness behind the veil\nC I feel suffering and no ending.\nB Stay away, keep your distance\nF The echoing emptiness is not empty.\nA Stay away, don’t challenge the other\nD Don’t fall down into the depth.\nD But I must fall into the depth,\nE Push aside the veil\nA And challenge the other,\nC This is the only way to an ending.\nF Make the emptiness not empty,\nB See what’s in the distance.\nB Now you have travelled this distance,\nD Fell down to this depth,\nF Seen that the emptiness is not empty,\nE Pushed aside the veil,\nC And reached for this ending.\nA In spite of the other.\nBE The distance behind the veil,\nDC The depth of the ending,\nFA The emptiness of the other."},"_Poetry/Sonnet-History":{"slug":"_Poetry/Sonnet-History","filePath":"_Poetry/Sonnet History.md","title":"Sonnet History","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"The sonnet is one of the oldest types of poem and they have been around for hundreds of years.
